[[TS - Utility Types|Utility types]] are predefined generic types in TypeScript that provide helpful and convenient transformations on types. These types allow us to manipulate and transform TypeScript types in a way that is more precise, easier to read, and less prone to errors. ^1a8ec0

Utility types can be used to create new types that are based on existing types, without the need to manually write out the full type definition. This can save time and reduce errors, especially when working with complex and deeply nested types.
