In TypeScript, the [[TS - Typeof Operator|typeof operator]] is used to determine the type of a variable or expression at runtime. It returns a string representation of the type of the operand. ^95e514

The `typeof` operator can be used with any expression, including variables, functions, and classes.

## Syntax

The syntax for using the `typeof` operator in TypeScript is as follows:

```TS
typeof operand
```

The `operand` can be any expression, such as a variable, function, or class.

## Examples

Here are some examples of using the `typeof` operator in TypeScript:

```TS
const myString = "hello";
console.log(typeof myString); // Output: string

const myNumber = 42;
console.log(typeof myNumber); // Output: number

const myFunction = function() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
};
console.log(typeof myFunction); // Output: function

class MyClass {
  public myProperty: string;
}
const myClassInstance = new MyClass();
console.log(typeof myClassInstance); // Output: object
```

In the above examples, the `typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a string, a number, a function, and a class instance.

Note that when the `typeof` operator is used with a class instance, it returns `"object"`. This is because a class instance is an object in JavaScript.

## Limitations

It's important to note that the `typeof` operator has some limitations in TypeScript. Specifically, it cannot distinguish between different types of objects, such as arrays and objects.

For example, if you use the `typeof` operator with an array, it will return `"object"`, just like it does for a class instance. This can make it difficult to determine the specific type of an object at runtime.

To overcome this limitation, you can use the `Array.isArray()` method to check if an object is an array. Alternatively, you can use TypeScript's type guards to check for specific types at runtime.
