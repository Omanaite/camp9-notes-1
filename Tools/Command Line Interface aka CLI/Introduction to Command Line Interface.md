It is type interface. Historically known as "terminal", as it was a device attached up to a mainfarame computer.

There is a prompt indicator ($ in many terminals) and can execute commands.

The most common use for a command interface is a Shell.


# Shell

A shell is a program that acts as a bridge between a user(s) and a device. In its most common forms, it gives the user the ability to interact with the Operating System and APIs (`system call`)

> `system call = API of OS`

Shells were one of the old ways to interact with a OS (before the days of GUIs)

The most common shells in use today are:
- BASH (Linux distros)
- ZShell (Mac)
- PowerShell (Windows)

## Shortcuts

- `~` is a shortcut for the path to the currently logged in user's home folder
- `.` is a shortcut for the path to the folder your shell is currently "in"
- `..` is a shortcut for the path to the parent folder just above the current location

#### Protip 
`Use TAB to autocomplete things, and double TAB for suggestions`

## Common Command Line Tools
Note: All commands that a shell can execute are actually programs. We can configure/pass data into these programs using `arguments` or  `flags`

- echo
- ls  (List out all the contents of the current folder)
- ls -a (unhide the hidden)
- cd (change the location from current to the new)
- mkdir 
- touch
- rm
- rmdir
- man (helps to show you all the add ons of a command line tool)
- nano (use as a command line text editor)
- cp (copy files)
- cat ( it can pull out the content from a file and display it)
- mv (move/rename)
- `>` to overwrite
- `>>` to add or append
