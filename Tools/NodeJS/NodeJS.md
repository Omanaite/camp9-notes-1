Node.js is a popular open-source JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, outside of the browser environment.

## What is NodeJS?

Unlike running JavaScript in a browser, which is limited to executing client-side scripts within the context of a web page, Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript to build full-fledged server-side applications, such as web servers, networking tools, and more.

The main difference between using Node.js and running JavaScript in the browser is the environment in which the code is executed. Browsers have a built-in JavaScript interpreter/engine, which allows them to execute JavaScript code within the context of a web page. This means that the code is limited to the capabilities of the browser, such as manipulating the DOM and handling user input.

On the other hand, Node.js provides a runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser, on the server-side. This enables developers to build more complex and powerful applications, such as web servers that can handle large amounts of traffic, real-time chat applications, and data-intensive applications.

Another key difference is the availability of APIs and modules. While browsers provide a limited set of APIs for client-side scripting, Node.js provides a rich set of built-in modules and APIs that enable developers to build powerful and flexible server-side applications. These modules include the HTTP module for building web servers, the File System module for working with files and directories, and the Crypto module for encryption and decryption.

### Summary:

In summary, the main difference between using Node.js and running JavaScript in the browser is the environment in which the code is executed, and the capabilities and APIs that are available to developers. While running JavaScript in a browser is limited to client-side scripting within the context of a web page, Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript to build powerful and flexible server-side applications.
