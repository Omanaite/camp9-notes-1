To get started with Node.js, let's create a simple [[NODE - Hello World Program|"Hello World" program]]. ^3bb104

1.  Open your code editor and create a new file called `hello.js`.
2.  In the `hello.js` file, type the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

This code will log the message "Hello, World!" to the console when you run the program.

3.  Save the `hello.js` file.
4.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello.js` file.
5.  Run the following command to execute the `hello.js` program:

```shell
node hello.js
```

This will run the `hello.js` program and display the message "Hello, World!" in the terminal.
