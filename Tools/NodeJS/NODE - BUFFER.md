In Node.js, a `Buffer` is a special object that represents a fixed-sized chunk of memory. A buffer is similar to an array of integers, but it is a low-level primitive that allows for direct manipulation of binary data.

Buffers are used to represent sequences of bytes, such as those that might be read from a file or network socket. Buffers are commonly used when working with binary data, such as images, audio, and video files, and are also used extensively in cryptography and networking.
